# OptRISQL_optimal_path

To transmit data generated at source IoDs, we used Q-Learning to get Optimal path that is energy efficient, from source to gateway. We implemented a RTS/CTS based routing in network that allows to scape data overflow and hence improved throughput at gateway as data loss is avoided by avoiding data overflow. Our implementation reduces the memory requirement of IoT network providing high throughput. Our model has some increased data latency but we may reduce it by increasing the queue size assigned to each source node.

Results:
1.  Improved throughput as data loss is decreased.
2.  Memory requirement of the time varying IoT network has been reduced.
3.  By using RTS/CTS protocol, we reduced the interference of nodes in the network.
4.  Transmission time increased but it may be reduced to some extent by increasing the queue size of source node.
